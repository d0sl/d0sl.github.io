	"content": "So, our main goal is to give a person the opportunity to describe logical rules in an understandable language. We call it D0SL or Delta Zero Semantic Language.\nFor this, we should to implement the language, as well as provide a convenient editor (or IDE Integrated Development Environment) that would allow to create D0SL documents and even immediately run.\nThere are various ways to reach this, but we choosed as a bases the powerfull Jetbrains MPS (Meta Programming System).\nYou should preinstall it from here\n\rWe choose MPS because:\n  MPS IDE is very similar to Intelliji Idea, PyCharm and other Jetbrains products. MPS helps to create powerful DSL (domain specific languages) and helps to create their powerful extensions.\n With MPS we can build plugins of D0SL Language for Intelliji Idea\n We were able to develop a technology that does not depend on the MPS and can be used separately. But we see no reason to abandon the convenience of the MPS where it is possible.   "

	"content": " Learn D0SL Semantic Platform Our goal is to develop a platform for automatic decision making based on a semantic approach.\nBy the semantic approach, we understand that people will be able to describe the rules in a language of logic, language that everyone understands, and is quite simple to use. Language to exclude everything superfluous, and only the most important to remain.\nRemember the three Laws of Robotics which govern the behaviour of Isaac Asimov\u0026rsquo;s fictional Positronic Robots were formally stated by Asimov in his story \u0026ldquo;Runaround\u0026rdquo; (March 1942):\n\r A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n  This is exactly what we want to turn into reality! Now there is a new industrial revolution. Neural networks drive a car instead of a person. Complex mechanisms and systems work longer and longer without human participation.\nBut there is a recognized problem in the field of artificial intelligence. Namely the black box problem. Even a neural network technician does not know what is going on inside.\nOur project is to help humanity to control artificial intelligence, autonomous systems (or even business processes) by using understandable domain specific language and human logic.\n\rgraph TB\rsubgraph With D0SL control\ra1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--a2[fa:fa-brain D0SL]\ra4[fa:fa-user Human logic]--a2[fa:fa-brain D0SL]\ra2--a3[fa:fa-car Car]\rend\rsubgraph Lone neural robot\rb1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--b2[fa:fa-car Car]\rend\r\r"
