	"content": " To run the chess sample  Find a semantic model ChessAII in org.d0sl.examples/sandbox Open the context menu on it by pressing the right mouse button. And select Run Node ChessAII.  To change semantic Semantic model is defined in sandbox/ChessAII. When the robot places the queens it calls check board predicate. In the semantic model in advance prepared several different predicates check board. Just change the name of the current check board predicate, and rename some other (e.g. check board1 name to check board. And you can see how the behavior of the robot changes depending on the given semantics.\nFor example, the following model will forbid a robot to put queens on one line, but he will be able to arrange them on one diagonal.\ndef check board2(board : ChessBoard) means check all var queens = ChessDSL.get queens(board) for all q1, q2 in queens not ChessDSL.on one line(q1, q2) end end def  After each change of the model, do not forget to rebuild the MPS solution (Ctrl+F9).\n\rJava part You can find the Java part of the example in org.d0sl.examples/chess\n First of all, pay attention to the ChessDSL class, which, using annotations, indicates the domain specific functions to which we refer in our semantic model. For example\n /** Represents a DSL for task: Arrangement of chess queens */ @DomainModel(name = \u0026quot;ChessDSL\u0026quot;) public class ChessDSL { \u0026lt;...SKIPPED...\u0026gt; /** Check if two queens are in the same horizontal or vertical @param @return */ @DomainFunction(name = \u0026quot;on one line\u0026quot;) public boolean onOneLine(ChessQueen q1, ChessQueen q2) { if (q1.getCol() == q2.getCol() || q1.getRaw() == q2.getRaw()) { return true; } return false; } /** Check if two queens are in the same diagonal @param @return */ @DomainFunction(name = \u0026quot;on one diagonal\u0026quot;) public boolean onOneDiagonal(ChessQueen q1, ChessQueen q2) { if (Math.abs(q1.getCol() - q2.getCol()) == Math.abs(q1.getRaw() - q2.getRaw())) { return true; } return false; } }  After that, in our semantic model, we can indicate in which class the implementation of predicates on one line and on one diagonal can be found.\nuse ChessDSL from org.d0sl.examples.chess.ChessDSL  Also in class ChessRobot you can find how the robot calls predicate check board from semantic model.\ntry { board.getBoard().setPieces(pieces); LogicalConstant check = semantic.callPredicate(\u0026quot;check board\u0026quot;, board); if (check.getValue() != Logical.TRUE) { pieces[i][j] = null; board.getBoard().setPieces(pieces); } else { boardPanel.setPiece(pieces[i][j], visit); boardPanel.refreshUI(); if (queenNumber == 7) { return true; } else { if (arrange(pieces, new LinkedList(), queenNumber + 1)) { return true; } else { pieces[i][j] = null; board.getBoard().setPieces(pieces); boardPanel.clear(visit); boardPanel.refreshUI(); } } } } catch (SemanticException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }  The algorithm is as follows: the robot puts the next queen and asks if everything is good. If the answer is positive, the robot tries to put the next queen, and if the answer is negative, the robot removes the last queen and searches for another cell for it. If a situation arises when it is impossible to place the next queen on any square, the robot goes back a step, cutting off the bad field.\n\r"

We call it D0SL or Delta Zero Semantic Language.\nFor this, we should to implement the language, as well as provide a convenient editor (or IDE Integrated Development Environment) that would allow to create D0SL documents and even immediately run.\nThere are various ways to reach this, but we chose as a bases the powerfull Jetbrains MPS (Meta Programming System).\nYou should preinstall it from here\n\rWe choose MPS because:\n  MPS IDE is very similar to Intelliji Idea, PyCharm and other Jetbrains products. MPS helps to create powerful DSL (domain specific languages) and helps to create their powerful extensions.\n With MPS we can build plugins of D0SL Language for Intelliji Idea\n We were able to develop a technology that does not depend on the MPS and can be used separately. But we see no reason to abandon the convenience of the MPS where it is possible.   "

	"content": " The eight queens puzzle The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.\nThe problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 (i.e., 64C8) possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8×8 board, but only 92 solutions.\n\rThe semantic way to solve this problem is as follows:\n Imagine that we have a robot that can arrange randomly eight queens on a chessboard. But he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether the position is the right one or not. Then, after each arrangement, the robot asks us if he placed the queens on the board correctly. If we say that is correct, the robot considers the task completed. And if we say what is wrong, the robot tries to place the queens in a different way. In order to determine whether the queens are placed correctly on the chessboard, we will write semantic rules in the d0sl language. For example: For any two queens on a chessboard, it must be true that they are not on the same diagonal, and they are not on the same line.  def check board(board : ChessBoard) means check all var queens = ChessDSL.get queens(board) for all q1, q2 in queens not ChessDSL.on one line(q1, q2) and not ChessDSL.on one diagonal(q1, q2) end end def  Next, we show how to run the example and see the code.\n\r"

	"content": " Learn D0SL Semantic Platform Our goal is to develop a platform for automatic decision making based on a semantic approach.\nBy the semantic approach, we understand that people will be able to describe the rules in a language of logic, language that everyone understands, and is quite simple to use. Language to exclude everything superfluous, and only the most important to remain.\nRemember the three Laws of Robotics which govern the behaviour of Isaac Asimov\u0026rsquo;s fictional Positronic Robots were formally stated by Asimov in his story \u0026ldquo;Runaround\u0026rdquo; (March 1942):\n\r A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n  This is exactly what we want to turn into reality! Now there is a new industrial revolution. Neural networks drive a car instead of a person. Complex mechanisms and systems work longer and longer without human participation.\nBut there is a recognized problem in the field of artificial intelligence. Namely the black box problem. Even a neural network technician does not know what is going on inside.\nOur project is to help humanity to control artificial intelligence, autonomous systems (or even business processes) by using understandable domain specific language and human logic.\n\rgraph TB\rsubgraph Or even embedding\rc1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--c2[fa:fa-car Car]\rc3[fa:fa-user Human logic]--c4[fa:fa-brain D0SL]\rc4--c1\rend\rsubgraph With D0SL control\ra1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--a2[fa:fa-brain D0SL]\ra4[fa:fa-user Human logic]--a2[fa:fa-brain D0SL]\ra2--a3[fa:fa-car Car]\rend\rsubgraph Lone neural robot\rb1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--b2[fa:fa-car Car]\rend\r\r"
