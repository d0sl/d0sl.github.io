	"content": " To run the chess sample  Find a semantic model ChessAII in org.d0sl.examples/sandbox Open the context menu on it by pressing the right mouse button. And select Run Node ChessAII.  To change semantic Semantic model is defined in sandbox/ChessAII. When the robot places the queens it calls check board predicate. In the semantic model in advance prepared several different predicates check board. Just change the name of the current check board predicate, and rename some other (e.g. check board1 name to check board. And you can see how the behavior of the robot changes depending on the given semantics.\nFor example, the following model will forbid a robot to put queens on one line, but he will be able to arrange them on one diagonal.\ndef check board2(board : ChessBoard) means check all var queens = ChessDSL.get queens(board) for all q1, q2 in queens not ChessDSL.on one line(q1, q2) end end def  After each change of the model, do not forget to rebuild the MPS solution (Ctrl+F9).\n\rJava part You can find the Java part of the example in org.d0sl.examples/chess\n First of all, pay attention to the ChessDSL class, which, using annotations, indicates the domain specific functions to which we refer in our semantic model. For example\n /** Represents a DSL for task: Arrangement of chess queens */ @DomainModel(name = \u0026quot;ChessDSL\u0026quot;) public class ChessDSL { \u0026lt;...SKIPPED...\u0026gt; /** Check if two queens are in the same horizontal or vertical @param @return */ @DomainFunction(name = \u0026quot;on one line\u0026quot;) public boolean onOneLine(ChessQueen q1, ChessQueen q2) { if (q1.getCol() == q2.getCol() || q1.getRaw() == q2.getRaw()) { return true; } return false; } /** Check if two queens are in the same diagonal @param @return */ @DomainFunction(name = \u0026quot;on one diagonal\u0026quot;) public boolean onOneDiagonal(ChessQueen q1, ChessQueen q2) { if (Math.abs(q1.getCol() - q2.getCol()) == Math.abs(q1.getRaw() - q2.getRaw())) { return true; } return false; } }  After that, in our semantic model, we can indicate in which class the implementation of predicates on one line and on one diagonal can be found.\nuse ChessDSL from org.d0sl.examples.chess.ChessDSL  Also in class ChessRobot you can find how the robot calls predicate check board from semantic model.\ntry { board.getBoard().setPieces(pieces); LogicalConstant check = semantic.callPredicate(\u0026quot;check board\u0026quot;, board); if (check.getValue() != Logical.TRUE) { pieces[i][j] = null; board.getBoard().setPieces(pieces); } else { boardPanel.setPiece(pieces[i][j], visit); boardPanel.refreshUI(); if (queenNumber == 7) { return true; } else { if (arrange(pieces, new LinkedList(), queenNumber + 1)) { return true; } else { pieces[i][j] = null; board.getBoard().setPieces(pieces); boardPanel.clear(visit); boardPanel.refreshUI(); } } } } catch (SemanticException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }  The algorithm is as follows: the robot puts the next queen and asks if everything is good. If the answer is positive, the robot tries to put the next queen, and if the answer is negative, the robot removes the last queen and searches for another cell for it. If a situation arises when it is impossible to place the next queen on any square, the robot goes back a step, cutting off the bad field.\n\r"

Computers can understand only exact sets of infrustrions explaining how to solve the problem. Such sets of instructions are called algorithms of computer programs.\nBut we humans in our every day life use logic in our language. Regular person could hardly remember all the instructions even for the washing machine. So we have special people who can do a translation between us humans and computers, which are called software developers or programmers. But the problem is that even after more than 70 year history of computers we still have less than 1% of population who can do such job.\nAlgorithms give computers an exact set of instructions on how to solve the problem. In order to create such algorithm you need to perform certain steps:\n Specify the problem in a manner, which excludes uncertainties. Such specifications should have rigid and logical form. Give it to programmers Eventually after several technological steps (such as architecture, OO design, etc) programmers convert the specification into a program written in some of programming languages Such program can now be translated into a machine code and executed on a computer.  This means that everytime we need to make computers to do something we have to have a computer program, which can be created only by software developers manually. Manual work as everybody knows involves human errors. So #1 problem is the Quality of software programs written by humans. Software bugs can kill any good intention.\nThe more programs we need, the more software developers will be involved. The more computers are used by humanity, the more programs we need, and even more developers will be required. Introduction of mobile phones, IoT and Edge Computing into everyday life creates more and more demand for programmers. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget that every mobile phone is a computer.

This problem #2 \u0026ndash; we have not enough programmers.\nAnd problem #3 \u0026ndash; is that mobile communications, robots, edge computing and Iot reiterates the problem of the quality: our civilization becomes more and more dependent on the quality of computer programs.\n"

	"content": " The eight queens puzzle The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.\nThe problem of finding all solutions to the 8-queens problem can be quite computationally expensive, as there are 4,426,165,368 (i.e., 64C8) possible arrangements of eight queens on an 8×8 board, but only 92 solutions.\n\rThe semantic way to solve this problem is as follows:\n Imagine that we have a robot that can arrange randomly eight queens on a chessboard. But he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know whether the position is the right one or not. Then, after each arrangement, the robot asks us if he placed the queens on the board correctly. If we say that is correct, the robot considers the task completed. And if we say what is wrong, the robot tries to place the queens in a different way. In order to determine whether the queens are placed correctly on the chessboard, we will write semantic rules in the d0sl language. For example: For any two queens on a chessboard, it must be true that they are not on the same diagonal, and they are not on the same line.  def check board(board : ChessBoard) means check all var queens = ChessDSL.get queens(board) for all q1, q2 in queens not ChessDSL.on one line(q1, q2) and not ChessDSL.on one diagonal(q1, q2) end end def  Next, we show how to run the example and see the code.\n\r"

And a predicate can return three values: true, false, and none (undefined).\nIf the predicate returns none, you must treat this as an exception. For example, a timeout occurred. none means that the predicate could not calculate true or false.\n\rTo create a predicate within the semantic model, you must type the keyword def. Then the predicate pattern appears. And you can specify the name of the predicate, its arguments, and the body of the predicate, which is a logical expression.\nThe predicate name may contain spaces. Also you can use not only Latin, but also other national alphabets ..\n\rThe predicate pattern is created without arguments. To add an argument, place the cursor inside the parentheses and press Enter or Insert.\n\rThe predicate body can be any logical expression of d0sl language: and, or, not, check all, if, for all. But for simplicity, we advise the body of the predicate to start with the check all instruction. check all instruction is equivalent of and instruction with many arguments each is in new line.\n\rPredicate example def check board(board : ChessBoard) means check all var queens = ChessDSL.get queens(board) for all q1, q2 in queens not ChessDSL.on one line(q1, q2) and not ChessDSL.on one diagonal(q1, q2) end end def  "

As any OS d0SL needs drivers to communicate with an environment: such drivers are called domain models.\n\rRevolution of autonomization Several new advancements in technology drive the next industrial revolution: 1. AI 1.0 technology: object recognition, machine learning and neural networks 1. IoT - Internet of Things 1. Edge Computing: process data into information on the edge, instead of uploading big data into clouds 1. AI 2.0 technology: semantic modelling and ontologies allow to process information into knowledge\nRemember the three Laws of Robotics which govern the behaviour of Isaac Asimov\u0026rsquo;s fictional Positronic Robots were formally stated by Asimov in his story \u0026ldquo;Runaround\u0026rdquo; (March 1942):\n\r A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\n A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\n A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\n  This is exactly what we want to turn into reality! Now there is a new industrial revolution. Neural networks drive a car instead of a person. Complex mechanisms and systems work longer and longer without human participation.\nBut there is a recognized problem in the field of artificial intelligence. Namely the black box problem. Even a neural network technician does not know what is going on inside.\nOur project is to help humanity to control artificial intelligence, autonomous systems (or even business processes) by using understandable domain specific language and human logic.\n\rgraph TB\rsubgraph Or even embedding\rc1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--c2[fa:fa-car Car]\rc3[fa:fa-user Human logic]--c4[fa:fa-brain d0SL]\rc4--c1\rend\rsubgraph With d0SL control\ra1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--a2[fa:fa-brain d0SL]\ra4[fa:fa-user Human logic]--a2[fa:fa-brain d0SL]\ra2--a3[fa:fa-car Car]\rend\rsubgraph Lone neural robot\rb1[fa:fa-robot Robot]--b2[fa:fa-car Car]\rend\r\r"
